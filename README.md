# Goodreads Streamlit App

Here lies my Streamlit Goodreads app! Check it out [here](https://goodreads.streamlit.app/). I also wrote a book on Streamlit called [Getting Started with Streamlit for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Streamlit-Data-Science-Create-interactive/dp/180324822X) if you're interested in creating your own apps, the [Streamlit documentation is also incredible](https://docs.streamlit.io/) and is a great way to get started as well.
